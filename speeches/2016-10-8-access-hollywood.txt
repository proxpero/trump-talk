You know and I moved on her, actually. You know, she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married. No, no, Nancy. No, this was — and I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, "I'll show you where they have some nice furniture." I took her out furniture — I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look. Whoa! Whoa! Look at you, you are a pussy. All right, you and I will walk out. Maybe it's a different one. Yeah, that's her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful, I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything. Oh, it looks good. Ooh, nice legs, huh? It's always good if you don't fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember? Hello, how are you? Hi! Nice seeing you. Terrific, terrific. You know Billy Bush? We're ready, let's go. Make me a soap star. O.K., absolutely. Melania said this was O.K. Good. After you. Come on, Billy, don't be shy. Get over here, Billy. Good, that's better. That's better. I don't know, that's tough competition. Which way? O.K. O.K. Oh, you're finished? Oh, good.
